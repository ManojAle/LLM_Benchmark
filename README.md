# Abstract
Large Language Models showed significant potential in the Code Generation. However, Consistancy of the code is not reliable enough in General Code Generation. On top of that, Performance related code optimization is very important while Generating code. our Objective is to analyze our PerfCurator Performance related codes to setup LLM benchmarking for various individual tasks. An Ideal Model should be generating the performance level code on its own with the descriptions. those descriptions can be preserved to high level performance code on its own. any lack of in-consistancy while generating code or generating descriptions will create a in-consistancy. so we plan to evaluate LLMs self consistancy when they do tasks Programming language to Natural language and Natural language to programming language with focus of performance related code data. Our Focus is to Explain the self consistancy of the LLMs on performance level data in the PL to NL and NL to PL. then we designed a framework to create this self consistancy with our PerfCurator performance data to evaluate the LLMs. Our study is to consider the top Code Generation models to Evaluate the performance level Individual LLM Tasks with our LLM benchmarking. 

## Introduction

For Evaluating Code LLMs people using Existing benchmaking CodeXBleu, HumanEval and so on. But for Evaluating Performance level Generation of the code using LLM is yet to be Explored. It requires high quality performance data to set it up robust Evaluation design. Also Conventional LLM individual tasks with LLMs is Primarily focus on the 

1. Code Generation: we Generate Code Generation from the clear description. it is a NL to PL task.
2. Code Summarization: we generate Summary for the code. it is PL to NL task.

As from Paper "BEYOND ACCURACY: EVALUATING SELF-CONSISTENCY OF CODE LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS WITH IDENTITYCHAIN" they have mentioned evaluating these two tasks in isolation overlooks their symmetric nature. NL-to-PL and PL-to-NL Generation can be thought of as semantic-preserving translation and back-translation between the PL space and the NL space. Therefore, a trustworthy model should be able to correctly perform PL-to-NL Generation given programs generated by itself from previous NL-to-PL tasks. Similarly, it should correctly perform NL-to-PL Generation given natural language specifications generated by itself from previous PL-to-NL tasks.they call such a property “self-consistency”.

Here, Our Primary objective is to show the self consistancy of the LLMs using our Performance data. Our performance data is mined from Git Repository. these data is crafted by various authors in the Git repositories. Our data will have Code before, Code After, Commit message, Category of the performance issue and patch informations. we collected a lot of high level performance code and categorized them into APIMisuse, MemoryInefficiency, PoorConcurrencyControl, InefficientI/O, 
 NetworkBottlenecks, InefficientAlgorithm/Data-structure, Parallelization, Micro-architectural. so we want to evaluate the LLMs on these categories. 
 
 Our design for the Experimentation is we want to check the LLM how it preserves to Generate the Source code from it's own description. we start with code summarization (PL to NL) using a top 4 7B LLMs in the Hugggingface Code LLMs leaderboard. we have used CodeInterpreter 7B, Artigenz Coder 7B, CodeQwen 7B, NXCoder 7B. we provide code before,code after and commit message as a input. we crafted a prompt to focus on the Performance in-efficiency in the code and how they fixed it. from this we were able to generate quality description which talks about the performance issue and how it is optimized using these top LLMs. for Next step our Code Generation task ( NL to PL) we provide code before + descritoption to optimize the issue in the code before. finally, we augument the code before and after with the help of LLM to executable code then we execute them in a Python environment to check the performance. For Augumenting the inputs as a executable code,  we use GPT-4o. we select all the Augumented code Manually to filter High quality data points. which will be used for Executable Experiment.

so, Executable Experiment, we run the code for N iterations 5 times to make sure our code before run for more than 5s. Normally, our NL to PL stage, LLMs struggle to generate the Optimized code as some lack of information in the description causes LLM to be not consistent in those cases. we wanted to experiment these for our performance related Examples which is crafted by humans. 


## Example Demonstration: 

Example-1:
Link: ```https://github.com/pygae/clifford/commit/36b59633b30acc3cfd0f7b1b9e5f541c720e2f3f```

This Example is categorized as a `Inefficient_Algorithm/Data-structure/Expensive_Operation`

**Performance Bug Explanation**:
### Bug in the Old Code
- **Inefficient Type Checking**:
  - The old code first checked if `other` was a numeric scalar (`numbers.Number`).
  - This incurred an expensive `isinstance` check, even though `MultiVector` operations were more frequent.

### Rectification in the New Code
- **Reordered Type Checks**:
  - The new code checks if `other` is a `MultiVector` first.
  - This prioritizes the more common case, reducing unnecessary overhead.

### PL to NL Results:
**Code Interpreter_7B**: It seems like there may be a misunderstanding. The provided information appears to be text from a GitHub commit. However, the prompt indicates that the task is to analyze the commit message, original code, modified code, and the differences between the original and modified code (code diff) to understand the improvements. 
To proceed, could you please provide the GitHub commit details in a different format or explicitly state the questions you want answers to?

**Arti-Genz-Coder-7B**: Based on the commit message and diff, following is the understanding and the optimization strategy:

Root Cause of Inefficiency: 
In the original code, `isinstance(other, numbers.Number)` check was done for both operations, while these checks were incorrectly done on every operation rather than just on `MultiVector <op> something_else` operation making comparison costly for a `MultiVector` with a `number`, causing a performance degradation.

Optimization Strategy: 
The change incorporated is a conditional check `isinstance(other, MultiVector)` before the inefficient `isinstance(other, numbers.Number)` check which would save the majority of the operations, hence making it more efficient. The main reason behind this was the primary operation scenario of `MultiVector <op> something_else`, hence, it's more efficient to check for this specific case first while previously, for other cases, we were executing the inefficient check.

The modified code now checks if the other argument is a `MultiVector` first before it tries to check if it's a number. This not only eliminates the unnecessary `isinstance(other, numbers.Number)` check but also increases the efficiency for the specific primary scenario. Hence, it will not only decrease the execution time but also will save resources.

The "Note" about the commit would be that the function has already been enhanced to check for a `MultiVector` first rather than using a `boolean` flag variable to check once. Therefore, the commit does not need any further notes.

**codeQwen-1.5_7B** 

Root Cause of Inefficiency:
The main root cause of the inefficiency in the original code lies in the line where it checks if `other` is an instance of `numbers.Number`. This check is unnecessary for the case that `other` is a `MultiVector`, as only instances of `MultiVector` should be considered for arithmetic operations. Therefore, the code is unnecessarily performing a redundant check, potentially leading to slower performance and unnecessary memory usage.

Optimization Strategy:
To optimize this code by addressing the identified inefficiency, we can modify the code to first check if `other` is a `MultiVector`. If it is, we will simply return it without performing any further checks or modifications. This optimization will bypass the unnecessary check of whether `other` is a `numbers.Number` and significantly improve the efficiency of the code. 
By implementing this optimization, we eliminate the redundant check of `other` being a `numbers.Number`, resulting in improved performance and reduced memory usage.

**NXCode_7B** 
Root Cause of Inefficiency:
The root cause of the inefficiency in the original code resides in the `_checkOther` function, specifically in the condition check for `isinstance(other, numbers.Number)`. This check unnecessarily introduces a runtime overhead by performing `isinstance` checks on other data types that are irrelevant to the actual operation. When `other` is a `MultiVector`, there is no need for a check since the operation only needs to be performed if `other` is a `MultiVector` and has the same `Layout` as the current `MultiVector`. Therefore, checking if `other` is a `MultiVector` first and directly performing the operation if it is the case ensures improved performance.

Optimization Strategy:
1. Move the check for `isinstance(other, numbers.Number)` to be the first condition in the `if` block. This means that if `other` is a `MultiVector`, it would be handled first before entering the `else` block that handles `numbers.Number`.

2. The optimization ensures improved performance by avoiding unnecessary type checks when `other` is a `MultiVector`. The check for `numbers.Number` can also be eliminated since the condition in the `else` block handles `numbers.Number` case, making it unnecessary.

This approach directly addresses the root cause of the inefficiency in the original code by minimizing type checks and improving efficiency. The commit message acknowledges the identified issue and provides a rationale for the optimization strategy. The modified code follows the improvements in terms of performance and resource utilization.
